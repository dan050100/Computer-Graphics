A very brief interactive animation, displaying the impact that climate control is having on sea levels. 

The openGL library was used in the eclipse IDE, to create a variety of shapes. Textures and lighting were also included to the scene to give it a sense of realism. Through the use of the P, O, E, G, and D keys, the user can visualise the scene changing. The X, Y, and Z keys can also be used to check the different angles of the scene.
